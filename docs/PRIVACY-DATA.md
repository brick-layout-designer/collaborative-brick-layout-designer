# Personal data map

What the server stores about people, where, and what happens to it.
Whoever runs a server is the data controller for it: this file is for
them, and for anyone answering a privacy request.

Kept in step with the code: `apps/server/src/privacy/collect.ts` reads
every table marked **Export: yes** for "Download my data", and
`privacyExport.test.ts` fails when a table is added that is neither read
there nor listed in `NO_PERSONAL_DATA`, or when a table is missing here.

Times are stored as Unix milliseconds. Nothing in the database records IP
addresses or browser user agents: the server reads the user agent only to
count browser vs desktop requests (`metrics/activity.ts`, counts only) and
to check the desktop app's version, and its web server log (stdout) is the
host's to keep or not.

## Accounts and sign-in

| Table | Personal data | Export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | email, display name, avatar URL, password hash, admin/moderator flags, created and last-seen times, deletion and restriction dates | yes (no hash) | `last_seen_at` is one time, rounded, no history. |
| `sessions` | which browsers are signed in, until when | yes (no ids) | The id is a hash of the cookie: a secret. |
| `api_tokens` | desktop sign-ins: name, prefix and last 4 characters, scopes, last used | yes (no hash) | Revoked rows are kept so the Devices list can show them. |
| `device_codes` | desktop sign-in codes a person approved or denied | yes (no codes) | Expire after minutes. |
| `oauth_accounts` | the Google / GitHub / OIDC account id linked | yes | |
| `email_verifications` | open "confirm your email" links | yes (no token) | |

## Moderation, limits and records

| Table | Personal data | Export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `warnings` | warnings and notes to a person, the reason, who sent and read them | yes | Also used for "your download is ready" notes. |
| `limit_overrides` | a person's own limits, suspension and its reason | yes | |
| `usage_daily` | per-person daily counts (requests, uploads, bytes) | yes | Numbers only; swept after `USAGE_RETENTION_DAYS`. |
| `daily_stats` | none | no | Site-wide daily numbers. |
| `audit_events` | who did what to which thing, with a JSON payload; some payloads name an email (invites, admin actions) | yes | No IP addresses or user agents. |
| `platform_settings` | `updated_by` (the admin who last saved) | as "site-settings-changes" | |
| `data_exports` | data downloads: about whom, asked by whom, when | yes | Files in `exports/<id>.zip` next to the database. |
| `privacy_requests` | requests logged by admins: type, the account or (with no account) who asked in the admin's words, dates, notes | yes | Closed ones are deleted after the records setting. After an erasure the request keeps the pseudonym. |
| `privacy_request_events` | the history of a request (which admin did what) | with its request | |
| `erasures` | none: a pseudonym, when, how, counts | no | Deleted after the records setting. |

## Files outside the database

| Where | What | Export |
|---|---|---|
| `bgimages/<layout id>.<ext>` | layout background pictures | inside the layout's `.bld-layout` |
| `exports/<id>.zip` | data downloads | n/a (it is the download) |
| `BACKUPS_DIR/cbld-*.sqlite.gz` | nightly database copies (7 daily, 3 weekly, 12 monthly) | no: they are copies of the above |

## The demo account

The one shared demo account (`users.is_demo_account`) holds sample
layouts and resets on a schedule. It belongs to nobody, so it can't
download its data.

## The desktop app

The desktop app keeps its layouts on the computer. On the server it has
only its sign-in (`api_tokens`, and the `device_codes` row it was approved
with) and whatever it publishes, which is stored like anything made on the
website. "Download my data" includes all of it.

## Deleting an account

"Delete my account" (Profile) waits first: 14 days by default, 7 to 30
in Admin › Settings › Privacy (`PRIVACY_DELETION_GRACE_DAYS` forces it).
The person is signed out of every browser; desktop sign-ins are refused
with `403 account_pending_deletion` (the desktop shows why). Signing back
in cancels it. An admin's "Delete" in Admin › Users erases at once.

When the account is erased (`privacy/accountDeletion.ts`):

| Data | What happens |
|---|---|
| `users`, `sessions`, `api_tokens`, `device_codes`, `oauth_accounts`, `email_verifications`, `user_preferences` | deleted |
| `org_members`, `org_join_requests` | deleted. A club they were the **last admin** of gets a new admin (its longest-standing manager, else member), who gets a note. A club with **nobody else** in it is deleted. |
| `layouts`, `modules`, `custom_parts`, `venue_library`, `catalog_items`, personal `catalog_collections` they own alone | deleted (with their background pictures and data downloads on disk). Copies other people added from the catalog are theirs and stay. |
| Club things they made | stay with the club: `created_by` moves to a club admin (it must name an account), `deleted_author_id` keeps the credit "Builder #…". A club collection they curate moves to a club admin. |
| `layout_collaborators`, `module_collaborators`, `custom_part_collaborators` | deleted: they leave share lists. Their edits to other people's layouts stay. |
| Invites and transfers they sent, or addressed to their email | deleted |
| `warnings` to them | deleted; warnings they sent keep `issued_by` empty |
| `usage_daily`, `limit_overrides` about them | deleted |
| `audit_events` | kept, pseudonymised: their rows get `actor_label` "Deleted user #abc123" and `user_id` empty; their email is replaced by "(erased)" in every payload, and their name in their own rows |
| `erasures` | a new row: kind, the pseudonym, how (self / admin / request), when, and counts only |

The last site admin can never be deleted.

## Privacy requests and restriction

Admin › Privacy requests logs requests that arrive by email, letter or in
person (access, erasure, rectification, restriction, objection, other),
each due a month after it arrived by default (`requestDueDays`). Overdue
and nearly-due ones (within 7 days) show a badge on the Admin menu entry
and a card on the dashboard. One-click answers, all audit-logged
(`privacy_request`) and kept in the request's history:

- **Export their data**: the same zip as "Download my data", for the admin to download and send.
- **Restrict**: `users.restricted_at`. The account is read only (every change refused with `403 account_restricted`, except signing in and out, reading notices, and downloading or deleting its own data), its live editing is read only, and what it owns alone is frozen for everyone (its role caps at viewer). Lifting it undoes all of that.
- **Erase now**: the erasure above, with no waiting time, after typing the account's email.

## Keeping data no longer than needed

Admin › Settings › Privacy, all adjustable, each forced by its env var
when set. The hourly privacy clean-up (`privacy/retention.ts`) applies them:

| Setting | Default | What goes |
|---|---|---|
| `exportKeepDays` | 7 days | data downloads (row and file) |
| `deletionGraceDays` | 14 days (7 to 30) | accounts waiting to be deleted are erased |
| `requestDueDays` | 30 days | (when a logged request is due) |
| `auditPersonalDays` | 365 days | email addresses, and any `ip` / `userAgent` field, in older audit payloads |
| `expiredSignInDays` | 30 days | expired sessions, revoked or expired desktop sign-ins, device codes, email confirmation links, unaccepted invites and offers |
| `recordsKeepDays` | 1095 days | erasure records, and closed privacy requests |
| always | | background pictures whose layout is gone |

`usage_daily` and `daily_stats` keep their own sweeps (`USAGE_RETENTION_DAYS`,
`ROLLUP_RETENTION_DAYS`). Backups keep 7 daily, 3 weekly and 12 monthly
copies; an erased account stays in older backups until they rotate out.

## Who sees email addresses

Display names never show an address (`publicName`). On a layout's,
module's or part's share list, addresses show only to the person
themselves, the owners (who manage sharing) and site admins; pending
invites (addresses only) show only to owners. Club member lists already
showed addresses only to the club's admins and managers.

## The privacy page

`/privacy` shows the notice an admin writes (markdown, Admin › Settings ›
Privacy) and the privacy contact (an email or web address;
`PRIVACY_CONTACT` forces it), with links to download your data and delete
your account. It is linked at the bottom of Home, on the sign-in page,
under Help in the menu, and on sign-up. The dashboard nudges while the
notice or contact is empty.

## Deleting a club

A club's admins delete it from its Settings; a site admin from Admin ›
Clubs. Before deleting, the admin can download the club's data (the same
zip format, about the club: members with their emails, invites, things,
collections, notices and its audit log; club admins only) and move all its
layouts or modules to a member or another club.

The confirmation lists what goes and asks what happens to anything the
club published in the public catalog: hand it to a member (the default;
they become its owner and it stays up) or take it down. Copies people
already added are theirs either way. Then the club's name is typed.

The club then **waits** (the same `deletionGraceDays` as accounts):

- it's hidden at once: its memberships move into `orgs.deletion_plan`
  (with whether it was listed and the catalog choice), so lists, pages,
  share links and access checks stop showing it; live editors close;
- every member gets a notice saying who deleted it, when it goes for good,
  and that its admins or a site admin can restore it;
- **Restore** (Clubs › Being deleted, or Admin › Clubs) puts the
  memberships back as they were.

After the wait (or a site admin's **Erase now**, behind the typed name)
the catalog choice is applied and the club goes with everything it owns
(`layouts`, `modules`, `custom_parts`, `venue_library`, members-only
collections, invites, join requests, notices), its background pictures and
club data downloads, leaving an `erasures` row ("Deleted club #…", counts).
`orgs.deleted_by` holds the id of whoever deleted it, without a foreign key.
