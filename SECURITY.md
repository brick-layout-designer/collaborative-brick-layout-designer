# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not file public GitHub issues** for security problems. Instead,
open a private vulnerability report via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability"
form on the repository, or email the maintainers.

## Layered scanning

This project runs the following automated checks:

| Check | Where | When | Gates merge/release? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pnpm typecheck` | local + CI | every commit / PR | yes (CI) |
| `pnpm test` (vitest) | local + CI | every commit / PR | yes (CI) |
| Conventional Commits lint | local + CI | every commit / PR | yes (CI) |
| **CodeQL** (JS/TS, security-extended) | GitHub | PRs, push to main, weekly | results in Security tab |
| **Dependency Review** | GitHub | PRs only | yes — fails on `high` severity or disallowed licenses |
| **OSV-Scanner** | GitHub | PRs | yes — fails on known CVEs in deps |
| **Gitleaks** | local pre-commit + GitHub | every commit / PR | yes (CI); local hook is best-effort |
| **Trivy** image scan | GitHub | nightly + release | nightly = report-only; release = fails on `CRITICAL` |
| **Dependabot** | GitHub | weekly | opens PRs (npm + actions + docker) |

## Credential handling

- **Sessions**: random 24-byte tokens; only the SHA-256 of the token is
  stored in the `sessions` table. A read of the database does not yield
  bearer tokens. (Verified by `apps/server/src/auth/session.test.ts`.)
- **Passwords**: argon2id via `@node-rs/argon2`; never stored in plaintext.
- **Cookies**: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production
  (`COOKIE_SECURE=true`).
- **OAuth account linking**: when a provider's email collides with an
  existing user, the user is shown a link-confirmation prompt rather than
  silently auto-merged. Prevents account takeover via a hostile provider
  claiming the same email. (Verified by `apps/server/src/auth/users.test.ts`.)
- **OAuth state + PKCE**: short-lived `cld_oauth_state` and
  `cld_oauth_verifier` cookies; mismatch → 400.

## Local scanning

`lefthook` installs git hooks via `pnpm install`. To run scans manually:

```sh
pnpm test          # full unit + integration suite
pnpm typecheck     # all workspaces
pnpm audit         # pnpm's built-in vuln check (production deps only)
pnpm scan:deps     # OSV-Scanner against package manifests + lockfile
pnpm scan:secrets  # gitleaks against the full history (requires gitleaks installed)
```

Install gitleaks locally to enable the pre-commit secret-scan hook:
<https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing>. Without it the hook
prints a notice and continues.

## Skipping a hook

`--no-verify` bypasses lefthook. CI runs the same checks again, so a local
bypass cannot ship; use it only for clearly-safe situations.
